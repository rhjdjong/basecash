# BaseCash

This project aims to provide a simple program for home finance,
i.e. keep track of expenses and enable budgetting.

The driving force behind this project is to create something that is:
- easy to use for non-financial people (like myself),
- allows specfiying both the 'what' and the 'why' of transactions.

To clarify the latter point: we have two cars in our household.
I want to keep track of how much each car costs.
What I want to achieve is that I can enter transactions that indicate both the *what*
of the car expenses
(fuel, maintenance, insurance, etc) and the *why* (car A and car B),
without having to resort to creating deeply nested sub-accounts for each car.
